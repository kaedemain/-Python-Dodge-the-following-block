Doge Dodge Game

Overview
Doge Dodge is a simple game developed as a practice project for learning Python. The objective is to control the character and avoid falling objects.  

How to Play
- Use the left (←) and right (→) arrow keys to move the character and dodge falling objects.  
- If an object lands on the character’s head, the game ends.  

Current Status
The game is incomplete and will no longer be actively developed. There is a known issue where the game occasionally ends prematurely, even when an object has not yet hit the character.  

Known Issue
- Sometimes, the game registers a collision before the object actually reaches the character.  

Although this issue remains unresolved, the project serves its purpose as a Python programming exercise.
